    descriptionGeneral="Dumbarton Oaks is a Harvard University research institute, library, museum, and garden located in Washington, DC. The institution is the legacy of Robert and Mildred Bliss, collectors of art and patrons of learning in the humanities. The museum houses world-class collections of Byzantine and Pre-Columbian art, two areas of interest to the Blisses. A third revolves around the historic garden, which Mildred Bliss created in close collaboration with renowned landscape designer Beatrix Farrand. Since 1940, when the Blisses gifted the estate and collections to Harvard University, Dumbarton Oaks has supported research in Byzantine Studies. Later it embraced Pre-Columbian and Garden and Landscape Studies. The support takes the form of fellowships and other awards, scholarly conferences, publications, and digital initiatives. In recent years, Dumbarton Oaks has also developed educational programs focusing on its collections and garden. <br/>Email:<a href='mailto:Library@doaks.org'>Library@doaks.org</a>"
    descriptionArchive="The Image Collections and Fieldwork Archives has come to represent one of the core research collections at Dumbarton Oaks. Begun in 1938, when Dumbarton Oaks founders Robert and Mildred Bliss purchased a copy of the Index of Medieval Art (formerly the Index of Christian Art) from Princeton University and funded a project called the Census of Early Christian and Byzantine Art, ICFA holdings have grown to encompass over one hundred discrete collections and over one million photographs. In 1941, Dumbarton Oaks gathered the first group of Byzantine fellows to systematically develop research materials and lists of monuments and sites that needed protection during the Second World War; the project was called the Research Archives. In the 1950s, ICFA began archiving documentation of archaeological fieldwork in Istanbul and beyond. In the early 2000s came the first donations of Garden and Landscape and Pre-Columbian materials including the papers of Renaissance landscape historian David Robbins Coffin, and the comprehensive photographic documentation of the Moche Archive. ICFA continues to collect, preserve, catalogue, and make materials available to Dumbarton Oaks fellows and other researchers worldwide."
