                          "descriptionGeneral": "I Tatti - The Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies is a center for advanced research in the humanities located in Florence, Italy. Its roots as a research institution date back to the late 1950s, when the art historian and connoisseur Bernard Berenson left his villa and extensive collections of books, photographs, and works of art to his alma mater, Harvard. The Center opened its doors to the first scholars in 1961, and the villa which had hitherto been home to Berenson and his wife Mary was transformed into an academic institution where gifted scholars could exchange ideas, find tranquility, study and write, and be physically close to the many sites of historical importance in Florence and beyond. The Harvard Center is dedicated to the exploration of all aspects of late medieval and early modern Italian culture and society, including the multi-faceted connections between Italy and the world beyond.",
                          "descriptionArchive": "The Photograph Archive, also known as the Fototeca, is part of the Berenson Library, which since Berenson’s bequest of I Tatti to Harvard has become a major resource for the study of all aspects of medieval and early modern Italy and related fields. Originating from the pioneering work of Bernard and Mary Berenson as art historians, the Photograph Archive has long been recognized as an outstanding resource for the study of the history of art. The collection now holds around 350,000 photographic prints and related materials, which document works of art in various media, ranging in date from antiquity to the mid-20th century. Its primary focus is on Italian art from the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance (roughly 1250 to 1650), predominantly painting and drawing – Berenson’s scholarly specialization – but also manuscript illumination, sculpture, and architecture. While representations of works of Italian art from this period constitute by far the largest part of the archive, other smaller sections reflect the Berensons’ broader global interests in the visual arts. These sections include sizeable groups of images of archaeology, early Christian, Byzantine and medieval art, post-Renaissance Italian painting (up to the 20th century), art and architecture in various European countries and Asian and Islamic art and architecture. The annotations on the back of many photographs offer insights into the Berensons’ working methods and Bernard’s influential career as an art critic and connoisseur. The photographs and associated notes also provide important documentation regarding individual works of art, such as their passage through successive collections, art dealers’ hands, or traces of restorations over time, as well as for the history of collecting and of the twentieth-century art market. Since Bernard Berenson’s death in 1959, the Photograph Archive has undergone significant growth through purchases, donations, and bequests, including the study photographs of art historians and conservators, as well as collections of early photograph albums.
