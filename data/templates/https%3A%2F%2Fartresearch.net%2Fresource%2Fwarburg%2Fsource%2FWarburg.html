    descriptionGeneral="The Warburg Institute is one of the world’s leading centres for the study of art and culture. Its collections, courses and programmes are dedicated to the study of global cultural history and the role of images in society. Founded in Hamburg at the turn of the twentieth century by historian Aby Warburg (1866-1929), the Institute was established to trace the roots of the Renaissance in ancient civilisations and ended up changing the way we see the world around us. The Warburg Institute owes its mission – and its very existence – to the open movement of people, collections and ideas. Sent into exile when the Nazis came to power, the Institute was transferred to England in 1933 and became part of the University of London in 1944. It has served, during a turbulent century, as a creative crucible for scholars, curators, artists and all those whose work sits outside traditional academic structures. The Warburg’s unique Library, Archive and Photographic Collection form a holistic, associative engine for exploring the histories of the arts and sciences – linking the textual and the visual, the intellectual and the social, the scientific and the magical. Following an extensive renovation of the Institute’s building in Bloomsbury, new spaces for exhibitions and events have restored the Institute’s original emphasis on discovery, display and debate and are bringing its holdings and programmes to new audiences. Building on Aby Warburg’s belief that the memory of the past activates the present, the Warburg examines the movement of culture across barriers – of time, space and discipline – to inspire, inform and connect. <br/>Email: <a href='mailto:photographic.collect@sas.ac.uk'>photographic.collect@sas.ac.uk</a>"
    descriptionArchive="The Photographic Collection of the Warburg Institute goes back to the ca 10,000 photographs assembled by Aby Warburg and Fritz Saxl in the early twentieth century. Today, the Collection contains ca 400,000 photographs of works of art from all over the world, from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia till the present day, albeit with a focus on Europe, and particularly Italy, and the period from Classical Antiquity till ca 1800. Several important art-historical projects have sprung from the Collection, among which the Census of Antique Art and Architecture known to the Renaissance and the Illustrated Bartsch are the most prominent. Special collections include the Eranos Archive of Jungian Archetypes and the Menil Archive of the Image of the Black in Western Art. The collection itself is expanded regularly through photographic campaigns, input of material from auction catalogues, and bequests. <br/>Photos in the Warburg Institute Photographic Collection are filed exclusively by subject. The Collection uses a unique iconographic classification system that was developed before IconClass and is more versatile and flexible than the latter. For example, Dürer’s Melencolia I is filed under Magic & Science – Four Temperaments – Melancholy – Female figure with putto(s). Next to it in the folder there are photographs of other images of melancholy: manuscript illuminations, book plates, woodcuts, drawings, engravings and paintings, some high art, most low art, from all over Europe, produced during a period of about 500 years.<br/>Since 2010, the Photographic Collection has also had a presence on-line: the Warburg Institute Iconographic Database (WI-ID). The WI-ID is an open-access resource for researchers interested in iconography and searching images by subject. It uses a subject taxonomy derived the Photographic Collection iconographic classification system, but it is not an electronic carbon copy of the analogue collection. It has been set up as a separate resource, based on old principles applied in a new environment. So far, about 20% of the Collection has been digitised and inserted into the database, but new material, for which there is no equivalent in the paper collection, has been added as well. The WI-ID is intended as the continuation of the Photographic Collection, and it is envisaged that future expansion of the Collection will take place in digital form only.<br/>Starting in 2020, the WI-ID has been moved to a new platform, underpinned by an XML data structure that offers the best guarantee for future preservation of the metadata. New admin and public interfaces have been designed by the London firm System Simulation, based on their CollectionsIndex+ and CollectionsOnline package (https://collectionsindex.com/). The new online format is styled to match the other web resources of the Warburg Institute. In line with the Institute’s traditions, it seeks to present materials using a combination of text and image. It adheres to the latest standards of online visual databases, including IIIF manifests for each of the images. "
