Research materials include over 400,000 monographs, periodicals, pamphlets, and exhibition, collection, and dealers’ catalogs as well as more than 100,000 auction catalogs. Archival materials augment the research collections with documents pertaining to the history of art collecting and Henry Clay Frick’s collecting in particular.",
                          "descriptionArchive": "The Frick Art Research Library Photoarchive was established in 1920 by Helen Clay Frick, daughter of the Gilded-Age industrialist and art collector Henry Clay Frick. Inspired by the personal library of reproductions of Sir Robert Witt in London, the Photoarchive was founded to provide researchers in the United States with the first public repository of images of works of art. As early as 1922, Helen Clay Frick organized photographic expeditions to record significant and rarely reproduced works of art in the United States and Europe. The resulting collection of 55,000 original negatives, which in many cases document works of art that have subsequently been altered, lost, or destroyed, has become one of the Library&#39;s most treasured assets. Currently, the Photoarchive contains more than one million photographic reproductions which are accompanied to varying degrees by rich documentation about attribution, provenance, conservation, as well as exhibition and bibliographic histories. During its more than 100 year history, the Photoarchive has collected and recorded thousands of unpublished opinions offered by visiting scholars about the works of art represented. The collection continues to grow through purchases and gifts from photographers, museums, scholars and dealers in the United States and Europe.",
