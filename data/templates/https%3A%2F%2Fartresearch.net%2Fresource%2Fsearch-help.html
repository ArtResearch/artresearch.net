                <h1>A Guide to Searching Pharos</h1>
            </div>

            <p>Our search tools are designed to support every kind of research, from finding a specific, known artwork to discovering new conceptual and visual connections across the collection. Understanding how to use the different search types—both combined and individually—will empower you to navigate the catalog with precision and make surprising discoveries.</p>
            <p>The search system is divided into two main approaches: <strong>Searching with Text</strong> and <strong>Searching with an Image</strong>.</p>

            <section id="searching-with-text">
                <h2>Searching with Text</h2>
                <p>When you type keywords into the search bar, our system is powerful and flexible. By default, all three text search types are active to provide you with the most comprehensive results. However, you have full control to select or deselect any combination of search types, allowing you to tailor your query for broad discovery or targeted precision.</p>
                <p>To help you understand why an item appeared, every result is labeled with indicators for the search types it matched: <span class="code-like">Text Match</span>, <span class="code-like">Textual Similarity</span>, or <span class="code-like">Visual Similarity</span>. Artworks that match multiple active search types are often the most relevant and will typically appear at the top of your results.</p>
                <p>Here is a guide to what each search type does and when you might want to use it.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 id="text-match">1. Text Match: For Precise Keyword Searching</h3>
                    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> This is a traditional, literal search. It finds records where the exact words you typed appear in the artwork's data (title, artist, notes, etc.).</p>
                    <p><strong>When to Use It:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>By default:</strong> It works alongside the other types to find exact matches.</li>
                        <li>Select <strong>only this type</strong> when you need the most literal results and want to exclude any conceptual or visual suggestions. This is ideal for finding a specific artwork by its known title or inventory number.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Keep in Mind:</strong> This search is language-specific. For cross-lingual searches, <em>Textual Similarity</em> is the essential tool.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 id="textual-similarity">2. Textual Similarity: For Conceptual & Multilingual Discovery</h3>
                    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> This is our most powerful tool for exploration. It understands the meaning behind your search terms, connecting your query to related ideas, themes, and subjects across the entire catalog, even across different languages.</p>
                    <p><strong>When to Use It:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>By default:</strong> This is the core discovery engine, finding related works you might otherwise miss.</li>
                        <li>Select this type when you want to explore a theme ("royal portraits"), research a broad topic, or when you are unsure of the exact terminology. Its ability to search across languages makes it invaluable for international collections. For example, a search for "water lilies" can find works titled "Les Nymphéas."</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 id="visual-similarity-from-text">3. Visual Similarity (from text): For Finding Visual Concepts</h3>
                    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> This unique mode translates your words into a visual query, finding artworks that look like the concept you've described. It searches for a mood, composition, or aesthetic.</p>
                    <p><strong>When to Use It:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>By default:</strong> It adds a layer of visual discovery to your text search.</li>
                        <li>Select this type when your query is primarily about a visual idea ("serene landscapes," "dramatic chiaroscuro"). It can even identify subjects in images without strong color cues, such as finding "red flowers" in a black-and-white photograph.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="searching-with-image">
                <h2>Searching with an Image (and Finding Similar Works)</h2>
                <p>These methods allow you to use an image as your search query. This can be done by uploading a file from your computer or by navigating to the "Similar Works" tab on an artwork's detail page. Unlike the text search, these modes are distinct and used one at a time.</p>
                
                <div>
                    <h3 id="visual-match">1. Visual Match: Finding Near-Exact Copies</h3>
                    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> This tool analyzes the "digital fingerprint" of your image to find near-identical matches in the catalog. It is designed to locate duplicates, not to find stylistically similar works.</p>
                    <p><strong>When to Use It:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To see if a specific artwork is in our collection.</li>
                        <li>To find all different records or photographs of the same artwork.</li>
                        <li>To identify an artwork from a cropped image or detail shot.</li>
                        <li>To locate a higher-quality version of an image you have.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3 id="visual-similarity-from-image">2. Visual Similarity: Discovering Aesthetic Connections</h3>
                    <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> This is a powerful discovery tool that finds artworks aesthetically related to your source image. It looks beyond a direct match to identify works sharing a similar style, mood, color palette, composition, or subject matter. It finds "artistic cousins" rather than "identical twins."</p>
                    <p><strong>When to Use It:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>To explore artistic influence:</strong> Upload a painting to find works by other artists who may have been inspired by it or worked in a similar style.</li>
                        <li><strong>On the "Similar Works" tab:</strong> This feature is used automatically to reveal other works in the collection that share an aesthetic with the piece you are currently viewing.</li>
                        <li><strong>To build a visual argument:</strong> Gather a group of thematically or stylistically similar works that may not be linked by traditional catalog data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="examples">
                <h2>Examples</h2>
                
                <div>
                    <h3 id="example-mona-lisa">Searching with an Image of the Mona Lisa</h3>
                    <p>Let's explore a practical example to see how our image search tools work. Imagine you have a link to a high-quality image of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and you paste it to the search bar. You have both <em>Visual Match</em> and <em>Visual Similarity</em> search types selected.</p>
                    <p>The system performs two distinct searches simultaneously, giving you a rich set of results that demonstrate the unique strengths of each tool.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Power of Visual Match: Finding the Original and Its Duplicates</h4>
                    <p>Your top results will be labeled with the <span class="code-like">Visual Match</span> indicator. These will be images that are almost identical to the one you uploaded.</p>
                    <p><strong>What You'll See:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The primary record for Leonardo's Mona Lisa from the Louvre Museum.</li>
                        <li>Other high-quality photographs of the same painting from different sources or archives.</li>
                        <li>This search is so precise it can even identify a manipulated version where the Mona Lisa is holding a guitar.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why It Works This Way:</strong><br>
                    Visual Match acts like a "digital fingerprint" scanner. It is designed to find exact or near-exact copies, which is why it correctly identifies the Photoshopped image—the underlying original is still a perfect match.</p>

                    <h4>The Power of Visual Similarity: Discovering Copies, Prints, and Influences</h4>
                    <p>Further down in the results, you will find a broader range of artworks labeled with the <span class="code-like">Visual Similarity</span> indicator. These results are not exact copies but are conceptually and aesthetically related to the Mona Lisa.</p>
                    <p><strong>What You'll See:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Copies of the Mona Lisa painted by other artists.</li>
                        <li>Prints, etchings, and other reproductions of the painting.</li>
                        <li>Other portraits from the same period or in a similar style that share compositional elements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Why It Works This Way:</strong><br>
                    Instead of matching fingerprints, Visual Similarity analyzes the artwork's essence—the three-quarter pose, the soft lighting (sfumato), the composition. It then finds other works in the collection that share this artistic DNA.</p>
                    
                    <h4>In Summary</h4>
                    <p>By using both search types on the Mona Lisa, you get a complete picture. Visual Match confirms the identity of the original painting, while Visual Similarity reveals its vast influence across art history.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 id="example-red-flowers">A Text Search for "Red Flowers"</h3>
                    <p>Let's explore what happens when you perform a common text search, like "red flowers," with all three search types enabled. The results demonstrate how these tools work together to go beyond simple keyword matching.</p>

                    <h4>1. The Role of Text Match: Finding the Exact Words</h4>
                    <p>The system looks for the literal words "red" and "flowers" in the artwork's data.</p>
                    <p><strong>What You'll See:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Direct title matches like "Still life with red and white flowers."</li>
                        <li>Surprising artist matches, such as works by Odilon <strong>Red</strong>on with "Flowers" in the title.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. The Role of Textual Similarity: Understanding Concepts and Languages</h4>
                    <p>The system looks for works conceptually related to "red flowers."</p>
                    <p><strong>What You'll See:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cross-language matches like titles with "Rode bloemen" (Dutch for "red flowers").</li>
                        <li>Thematic matches like "Geraniums," as the system knows a geranium is a type of flower.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. The Role of Visual Similarity: Finding a "Look and Feel"</h4>
                    <p>The system analyzes the images to find visual representations of "red flowers."</p>
                    <p><strong>What You'll See:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Obvious visual matches in colorful still life paintings.</li>
                        <li>The "Aha!" moment: A black-and-white photo of "Geraniums" gets a match because the AI recognizes the shape and form of the flowers, regardless of color.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Bringing It All Together: Why the Best Results Have Multiple Tags</h4>
                    <p>The top results often have multiple indicators. For example, Odilon Redon's "Wild Flowers in a Tall Vase" gets all three tags, making it an exceptionally strong match and placing it at the top.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3 id="example-woman-hands">The Nuance of Searching for "Study of Woman Hands"</h3>
                    <p>This example shows how a Text Match can be technically perfect but miss the user's goal, and how Textual and Visual Similarity are essential for delivering relevant results.</p>
                    
                    <h4>1. The Literal Power of Text Match: A Surprising Result</h4>
                    <p>A search for "study of woman hands" returns Frank Duveneck's "Study of a Woman's Head" with a <span class="code-like">Text Match</span> indicator.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why It's a "Perfect" Match:</strong> The artwork's metadata contains the keywords in the Subjects field: <em>Portraits: Women: <strong>Without hands</strong>: Head to right</em>. The tool found the words but missed the negative context.</p>

                    <h4>2. Textual Similarity: Understanding Your True Intent</h4>
                    <p>This is where the system's intelligence shines. Nearly all correct results are tagged with <span class="code-like">Textual Similarity</span>.</p>
                    <p><strong>What You'll See:</strong> Works with German titles like "Zwei Studien für Frauenhände" (Two Studies for Woman's Hands) because it understands the concept and language.</p>

                    <h4>3. Visual Similarity: Finding What You Want to See</h4>
                    <p>All correct results also get the <span class="code-like">Visual Similarity</span> tag, confirming the system "sees" hands in the images. The "Study of a Woman's Head" does not receive this tag, signaling it's an outlier.</p>

                    <h4>Bringing It All Together: Why a Blended Search Succeeds</h4>
                    <p>This example perfectly illustrates the platform's philosophy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Text Match</strong> is a literal tool that can lack contextual understanding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Textual Similarity</strong> deciphers your true intent and breaks down language barriers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Visual Similarity</strong> acts as essential confirmation, verifying that the artworks visually represent the subject.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By combining these approaches, the system is designed to understand what you <em>mean</em>, not just what you <em>type</em>.</p>
