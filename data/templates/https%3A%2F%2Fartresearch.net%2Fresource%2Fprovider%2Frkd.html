As a knowledge centre, the RKD promotes research into the visual arts of the Low Countries, by our own staff as well as by collaborating with others such as museums, cultural heritage institutions and universities worldwide. In addition, the RKD’s collection and expertise is widely used by auction houses, galleries, art dealers, independent scholars, professional art historians, collectors and students looking for art historical information. RKD’s databases are accessible to everyone via the online research platform RKD Research, in which an infinite amount of data and sources on works of art and artists are accessible.",
                          "descriptionArchive": "The RKD holds more than 5 million digital and analogue images of artworks, making it one of the largest collections in the world. It also houses collections relating to portrait iconography and topography, and there are also huge numbers of historical photographs in the archives. The collection of visual documentation boasts more than 4 million photographs, reproductions and slides of artworks. The emphasis of the collection is on Dutch and Flemish art from the late Middle Ages to the present day, but other Western art is also well represented. All the material is accessible via RKD Research. Researchers can also gather valuable information about works of art from the data accompanying the images. The portrait collection includes approximately 80,000 photographs and reproductions of paintings portraying historical figures, as well as photographic portraits of ordinary Dutch people from the period 1840-1920. A substantial portion of these are in the form of cartes de visite, small portrait photographs that people collected in albums. The portraits can be accessed via RKD Research, and are searchable by sitter. The RKD stores more than 10,000 historical photos. Among the highlights is the collection of 2300 original glass negatives and photographic prints made by George Hendrik Breitner. Much early photographic material is also contained within the archives and some of this material is available via RKD Research. The historical topography collection holds more than 100,000 photographs and reproductions of topographical images of Dutch and Belgian cities, villages, as well as pictures of churches, castles, windmills and interiors.",
