        PHAROS is an international consortium of
        <u><mp-link url="/resource/Partners">fourteen</mp-link></u>
        &nbsp;European and North American art historical photo
        archives&nbsp;committed to creating a digital research platform allowing
        for comprehensive consolidated access to photo archive images and their
        associated scholarly documentation.

        Established in 2013, PHAROS&nbsp;responds to the need for the rich
        visual and textual material held in art-historical photo archives, often
        unpublished and uniquely accessed through&nbsp;these repositories, to be
        made accessible for a new generation of scholars accustomed to online
        access to research materials. Consolidated access to tens of millions of
        images of works of art will be of immeasurable value to scholarship and
        teaching for a wide range of art-historical issues. These include
        provenance and attribution, conservation research, exhibition research,
        publication history, the history of photography, as well as the history
        of art history.&nbsp; Above all, PHAROS aims to provide an essential
        resource for those engaged with new research methodologies within the
        framework of digital humanities.

      <strong>Brief History</strong>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        At its first meeting, supported by a grant from the Samuel H. Kress
        Foundation, directors and staff of the research institutes responsible
        for fourteen major photo archives in Europe and the United States
        prepared a statement of purpose&nbsp;that outlined both long- and
        short-term goals. Since that first meeting, a technology working group
        determined that the most promising solution for achieving consolidated
        access to the documentation on roughly 31 million images of works of art
        held by PHAROS institutions would be to map the data to the
        <u><a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/" target="_blank">CIDOC CRM</a></u>
        &nbsp;ontology and transform it into linked open data (LOD) for eventual
        contribution to
        <u><a href="http://www.researchspace.org/" target="_blank">ResearchSpace</a></u>
        . In 2014-2016, with funding from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, Pharos
        collaborated with John Resig, the creator of JQuery and the Dean of
        Computer Science at Kahn Academy, to create an image recognition
        tool&nbsp;for the consortiumâ€™s Italian images similar to the one he
        created for
        <u><a href="http://ukiyo-e.org" target="_blank">Japanese Woodblock prints</a></u>
        . The
        <u><a href="http://images.pharosartresearch.org/">PHAROS Art Research Database</a></u>
        , &nbsp;launched in September 2016, enables searching image to image
        without the mediation of language, using an interface that allows users
        to perform searches for their own images against those held in the
        PHAROS database, as well as to find multiple images of the same work of
        art along with accompanying documentation from multiple photoarchives.
      </p>
      <strong>Current Status</strong>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        As of Fall 2016, members are in various stages of working on converting
        historical documentation about the works of art to electronic form,
        reconciling relevant data with agreed upon authorities, mapping the data
        to the CIDOC-CRM ontology and digitally capturing all of their
        photographs.&nbsp; As these steps are accomplished, images and data will
        be made available in the computer vision database as well as on
        <a href="http://www.researchspace.org/">ResearchSpace</a>.

      <strong>Summary of Concept and Goals</strong>
      <div>
        <p>
          PHAROS: An International Consortium of Photo Archives is a
          collaborative project among fourteen photo archives in North America
          and Europe established to create a common platform for research on
          images of works of art in all media, both Western and non-Western,
          through comprehensive consolidated access to photograph archives. This
          freely available commons is designed to stimulate research in a broad
          spectrum of fields by linking together for the first time all of the
          images and their formal documentation with knowledge amassed by
          scholars over the years. Consolidated access to tens of millions of
          images of works of art will be of immeasurable value to scholarship
          and teaching for a wide range of art-historical research topics
          including provenance and attribution, conservation research,
          exhibition research, publication history, the history of photography,
          the history of art history, and a myriad of other points of
          information that we can hardly imagine. &nbsp;The project will also
          foster a greater understanding of the photograph as physical object
          and its critical role in the dissemination of knowledge.
