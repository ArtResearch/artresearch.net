# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to artresaerch ! 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to begin with. We try our best to be a nice and welcoming community.

In this guide you will find a short overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

If you are willing to contribute in some way or get involved, please contact the Pharos Technical Working Group (TWG). Tipically we foresee opening a detailed issue about the changes needed or proposed, and a PR to address this or part of this.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, first search existing issues to see if it has been reported previously. If not, please, open an issue, and use one of the provided templates for that. Help everyone by trying to be as complete as possible with examples and clear descriptions. Be ready to complete your issue with integrations. 

#### Solve an issue

If you plan to solve one or more issues, please assign them to your self as soon as possible. You can always contribute to issues assigned to others of course!
You should be able to test locally your proposed changes before doing a PR.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Please add enough documentation to describe your changes but not too much.

Please make your PRs as concise as possible, and summarize changes made in a readable manner to facilitate review.

Please, link related issues to the PR.

#### TWG organization and Review
The Pharos TWG will link other related issues if relevant to your PR. Upon notification (via email) or at the next useful meeting, one or more TWG members will look at your PR and manage it, so that it appears in the right places. The reviewer will also merge, test and follow up on related issues.  

#### Applications repository
After Review the PR will be merged, and the live application will reflect those changes in about 30 minutes. 

Further testing will take place and eventually related issues will be assessed and closed by members of the TWG.

#### Data repositories
Changes made to repository which are related to the ingestion of data will be documented in the same why, but additional testing will happen on a dev instance (TBD).



### Your PR is merged!

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be visible in the repository.
