    descriptionGeneral="Germany’s documentation center for art history, Deutsches Dokumentationszentrum für Kunstgeschichte – Bildarchiv Foto Marburg, was founded in 1913. It is a documentation and research institute for visual cultural assets, institutionalized as a central facility at Philipps-Universität Marburg. It is one of the largest scholarly image collections focussing on art history and archaeology in the world. In the field of art-historical services and research institutes, Foto Marburg is an outstanding and renowned institution. Active within Germany and internationally, the documentation center is tasked with documenting Europe’s monumental cultural heritage for scientific research and enabling access to it with the aid of cutting-edge media technologies. To this end, top-grade photographs are produced or acquired from third parties, scientifically analysed in accordance with recognized standards and made available to researchers and the public. The focus is on objects examined within the field of art history and its related disciplines, e.g. archaeology. These are in particular architectural monuments, furnishings and collectors’ items from cultural institutions in all sectors in Germany and Europe. Unique in terms of its collection, Foto Marburg has been a point of reference in the field of documentation methods and IT/data processing solutions for decades and is among those institutes that set professional standards in handling primary information in the area of cultural studies. Foto Marburg’s key role in terms of making art-historical primary information accessible to the public is evident in its intensive collaboration over many years with German and international institutes that work to preserve and document visual cultural assets. According to its statutes, one of its primary tasks is to conduct research on all aspects of how visual cultural assets are passed on, in particular in relation to the media and the history of science, as well as on the documentation and interpretation of works of architecture and art. The research results are presented in the form of academic events and publications. The research program for the coming years centers on how things are visually passed on in light of the accompanying media-related transformations of the visual, including the political instrumentalization and social evaluation of works of architecture and art and their visual representations (graphics, photographs, digital versions, etc.). A second focal point is the selection, distinction and amplification, i.e. the process of canonization as part of social value formation, that take place in the course of passing on cultural assets."
    descriptionArchive="The Photographic Collection of the Warburg Institute goes back to the collection of around 10,000 photographs assembled by Aby Warburg and Fritz Saxl. Today, the Collection contains ca 400,000 photographs of works of art from all over the world, from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia till the present day, albeit with a focus on Europe, and particularly Italy, and the period from Classical Antiquity till ca 1800. Several important art-historical projects have sprung from the Collection, among which the Census of Antique Art and Architecture known to the Renaissance and the Illustrated Bartsch are the most prominent. Special collections include the Eranos Archive of Jungian Archetypes and the Menil Archive of the Image of the Black in Western Art. The collection is expanded regularly through photographic campaigns, input of material from auction catalogues, and bequests. Photos in the Warburg Institute Photographic Collection are filed exclusively by subject. The Collection uses a unique iconographic classification system that was developed before IconClass. For example, Dürer’s Melencolia I is filed under Magic & Science: Four Temperaments: Melancholy: Female figure with putto(s) etc. Next to it in the Melancholy folder there are photographs of other images of melancholy: manuscript illuminations, book plates, woodcuts, drawings, engravings and paintings, some high art, most low art, from all over Europe, produced during a period of about 500 years. Since 2010, the Photographic Collection has also had a presence on-line: the Warburg Institute Iconographic Database (WI-ID). The WI-ID uses a variant of the Photographic Collection iconographic classification system but is not an electronic carbon copy of the analogue collection. It has been set up as a new resource, based on old principles applied in a new environment. So far, about 20% of the Collection has been digitised and entered into the database, but new material, for which there is no equivalent in the analogue collection, has been added as well. The WI-ID is intended as the continuation of the analogue Photographic Collection, and it is envisaged that future expansion of the Collection will take place in digital form only."
