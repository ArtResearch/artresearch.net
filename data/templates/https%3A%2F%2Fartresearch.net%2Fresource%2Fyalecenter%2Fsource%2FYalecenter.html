Presented to Yale University by Paul Mellon (Yale College, Class of 1929), the Center holds the largest and most comprehensive collection of British art outside the United Kingdom, presenting the development of British art and culture from the Elizabethan period to the present day. Located in the final building designed by Louis I. Kahn, the YCBA is a focal point for modernist architecture. It is free and open to all and is a partner to the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.<br/>Email: <a href='mailto:kraig.binkowski@yale.edu'>kraig.binkowski@yale.edu</a>"
    descriptionArchive="The YCBA Photo Archive is a collection of approximately 132,000 black and white reference photographs (82,000 fully catalogued, 50,000 uncatalogued) of British paintings, drawings, watercolors, sculpture, and prints from the sixteenth to the early twentieth centuries. The vast majority of the works of art documented in the archive were created before 1900. British artists are the overwhelming focus of the archive but it also includes Irish, Scottish, and Australian artists. The photographs in the archive were acquired from public and private collections, galleries, and auction houses in the UK and North America, from 1975 until 2000 and often in conjunction with the Paul Mellon Centre in London. Cataloged photos include 32 fields of information and a full list of associated subject headings. The photos are part of the YCBA Reference Library collections."
