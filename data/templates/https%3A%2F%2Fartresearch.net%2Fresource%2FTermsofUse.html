          <p>The PHAROS Association (“PHAROS”) has created and maintains a digital research platform allowing for consolidated access to art historical photo archive images and their associated scholarly documentation (“PHAROS Platform”). Our mission is to publish these materials as openly as possible and provide an essential resource for those engaged with new research methodologies within the framework of digital humanities. Using the PHAROS Platform, Users can access, search, and contribute new information to a large database of images and data held by archives, museums, and libraries (“PHAROS Members”). PHAROS supports this by aggregating Metadata provided by PHAROS Members, maintaining the database, and facilitating access through the PHAROS Platform. </p>

          <p>Please note that it is a requirement that any contributions by Users to the Platform are made available to others under the terms of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a> (CC0 1.0).

          <h3>Ownership of PHAROS Content</h3>
          <p>PHAROS compiles and makes available content on the Platform, which includes but is not limited to Digital Surrogates of archival documents and photographs, as well as text, information and data on objects, Metadata, design, codes, and software (“Content”).
