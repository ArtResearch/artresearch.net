          <p>Open Access has been an objective of PHAROS since its inception.  In the development of <a href="https://artresearch.net/">artresearch.net</a>, PHAROS has explored and defined its intellectual property obligations alongside its scholarly objectives, balancing the benefits of the free and open exchange of knowledge and culture with the interests of rightsholders. </p>
          <p>As part of PHAROS’ intellectual property considerations, the consortium has examined the differences in copyright laws and conventions across the countries and territories of its member institutions, among other issues.  Results of these inquiries have been openly published in the report International Copyright Workshop: Providing Online Access to Art Historical Research Photography Collections.</p>
          <p>PHAROS’ <a href="/resource/OpenAccessPolicy">Open Access Policy</a> outlines the consortium’s approach to open access and how to differentiate what content you can use, and under what terms.  All material in the PHAROS platform, from metadata to images, is free to access, view and read.  Importantly, PHAROS members claim no new or additional rights in digitized material, including images, that they have contributed to the platform. However, your use of digitized material is subject to the rights status of the underlying items depicted in the material, which may include not only copyright status of art objects, but contractual terms governing the original analog photography. You may freely reuse any metadata contributed to the platform, which members have published under a CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication.</p>
          <p>It is also important to note that under the platform’s <a href="/resource/TermsofUse">Terms of Use</a>, any user contributions you make are published under a CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication as well.  The tenets of the <a href="/resource/OpenAccessPolicy">Open Access Policy</a>, in conjunction with the platform’s <a href="/resource/TermsofUse">Terms of Use</a>, ensure that all content contributed to artresearch.net remains freely accessible moving forward.</p>
          <p>If you do not agree with the <a href="/resource/OpenAccessPolicy">Open Access Policy</a> , <a href="/resource/TermsofUse">Terms of Use</a>, and <a href="/resource/PrivacyPolicy">Privacy Notice</a>, you may not use the PHAROS Platform or services.</p>
