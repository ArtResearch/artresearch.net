                          "descriptionGeneral": "The National Gallery of Art was conceived and given to the people of the United States by Andrew W. Mellon (1855–1937) and serves the nation by welcoming all people to explore and experience art and creativity.  We develop the understanding of art through collecting and exhibiting in ways that reflect our nation and its histories.  Through the generosity of many benefactors, the National Gallery has become one of the preeminent art museums in the world. ",
                          "descriptionArchive": "The Department of Image Collections of the National Gallery of Art Library is a study and research center for images of principally Western art and architecture and is one of the largest of its kind, numbering over 16 million photographs, digital images, negatives, slides, and microforms. The department serves a national and international audience that includes the Gallery&#39;s staff, members of the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts, scholars, and interested researchers. With over 8 million photographs of works of art and architecture, ranging from daguerreotypes to copy prints, the nucleus of the collection (some 60,000 photographs) was formed with the purchase of the George M. Richter Archive in 1943 with funds donated by Solomon Guggenheim. Beginning in 1970 and continuing for the next thirty years, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation provided funding to build the collections through the acquisition of photographs from scholars, photographers, art dealers, universities, and museums. Particular areas of strength are in Italian, Netherlandish, French, American, British, Modern art and architecture, and the arts of Asia. Information about our extensive rare and special collections can be found on the Department of Image Collections webpage (link above). Access to the collection is provided through the Library&#39;s online public catalogue where approximately 350,000 digital files can be viewed in connection with the records for individual artworks and buildings.",
