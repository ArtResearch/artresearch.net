            PHAROS is an international association that currently brings together
            fourteen art historical photo archives based in Europe and North
            America. It is committed to creating a freely available digital research
            platform that provides interoperable access to millions of photo
            archive images and associated scholarly documentation.          </p>

          <p>
            Established in 2013, PHAROS intends to make the rich visual and
            textual material held in art historical photo archives – most of which is
            unpublished and accessible only on site – available to a global
            community of researchers. Photo archives have long been the
            laboratories of art history students and scholars, curators, and
            dealers. As Pharos partners, we are now digitizing our analog
            photographs, consolidating our records of images and works of art,
            and enriching them through linked open data. We are also drawing on
            new technologies such as computer vision and artificial intelligence.
            Through these means we are opening our collections, creating
            connections between them, and facilitating new research through the
            artresearch.net discovery platform.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <strong>Scope</strong>
          <p>The holdings of the current partners deal primarily with the cultural
            heritage of Europe and North America. Expanding this scope is a
            major objective of PHAROS, and we are actively seeking to involve
            photo archive collections and institutions based in other regions of the
            world and whose emphasis is on non-Western art and architecture.
            We recognize that photo archive collections reflect and respond to the interests, biases and tastes of the archivists, librarians and custodians
            that gathered them together.</p>
          <p></p>
          <strong>Research objectives</strong>
          <p>The partners of PHAROS maintain that open access to millions of
            images of works of art and architecture as well as to their metadata
            will be of immeasurable value to research and teaching for a wide
            range of art-historical issues and for the humanities in general.
            Possible areas of research include – but are not limited to –
            provenance, attribution, iconography, conservation, material culture,
            exhibition research, publication history, the history of photography and
            imaging techniques, as well as the history of art history and other
            disciplines. The project will also foster a greater understanding of the
            photograph as physical object and its critical role in the dissemination
            of knowledge. PHAROS aims to provide an essential resource for
            those engaged with new research methodologies within the framework
            of digital humanities.</p>

          <strong>DEAI statement</strong>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            PHAROS is committed to the values of diversity, equity, accessibility,
            and inclusion (DEAI) as well as to cultivating a culture of care,
            collaboration, and community for all researchers regardless of
            individual identity or background.
            <!-- At its first meeting, supported by a grant from the Samuel H. Kress
            Foundation, directors and staff of the research institutes responsible
            for fourteen major photo archives in Europe and the United States
            prepared a statement of purpose&nbsp;that outlined both long- and
            short-term goals. Since that first meeting, a technology working group
            determined that the most promising solution for achieving consolidated
            access to the documentation on roughly 31 million images of works of art
            held by PHAROS institutions would be to map the data to the
            <u><a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/" target="_blank">CIDOC CRM</a></u>
            &nbsp;ontology and transform it into linked open data (LOD) for eventual
            contribution to
            <u><a href="http://www.researchspace.org/" target="_blank">ResearchSpace</a></u>
            . In 2014-2016, with funding from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, Pharos
            collaborated with John Resig, the creator of JQuery and the Dean of
            Computer Science at Kahn Academy, to create an image recognition
            tool&nbsp;for the association’s Italian images similar to the one he
            created for
            <u><a href="http://ukiyo-e.org" target="_blank">Japanese Woodblock prints</a></u>
            . The PHAROS Art Research Database
            , &nbsp;launched in September 2016, enabled searching image to image without the mediation of language, using an interface that allowed users to perform searches for their own images against those held in the PHAROS database, as well as to find multiple images of the same work of art along with accompanying documentation from multiple photo archives. This functionality has been incorporated into the pilot project platform as <u><mp-link url="/resource/VisualSearch" target="_blank"> Visual Search </mp-link></u> -->
          </p>
          <p>Our organization acknowledges that photo archive collections are
            shaped by the histories of collecting and creating knowledge about art
            and are also inextricably linked with the people and institutions that
            have amassed these data banks of images over many decades. The
            Eurocentric focus of academic and collecting institutions has been
            complicit in creating and perpetuating bias. As part of its mission,
            PHAROS is engaged in scholarly communication and dialogue that contributes to the ongoing work of undoing discriminatory systems
            based on race, gender, sexuality, class, religion, and ability—both in
            our organization and in the fields of art history, collecting studies,
            photography studies, and museology at large.</p>
