                          "descriptionGeneral": "The Federico Zeri Foundation is a center for research and training highly specialized in the History of Art. It was set up in 1999 by the University of Bologna with a view to making known the life-work and profile of Federico Zeri (1921-1998), as well as preserving his bequest and turning it to best account: an art library (46,000 volumes), a collection of 37,000 auction catalogs and a photo archive (290,000 photographs). In addition to managing and enhancing its collections, the Foundation runs courses and seminars on art-historical or photo-historical topics for senior students, scholars, librarians and archivists, promotes scholarships and research projects, offers study grants, publishes of scientific texts, holds study days, meetings and special lectures open to the public. The Foundation occupies part of the Renaissance convent of Santa Cristina in the old town centre of Bologna. The same complex hosts the Bologna University Department of Visual Arts. Together, the two institutes form a scientific hub and represent an important resource for research into visual arts in northern Italy.",
                          "descriptionArchive": "The Fototeca Zeri is a collection of 290,000 photographs of artworks and monuments, organized, expanded and improved by the scholar throughout his entire career. In common with other famous connoisseurs like Bernard Berenson and Roberto Longhi, Federico Zeri found the photo archive an indispensable tool in studying as well as in philological analyses of artworks. Besides its rich Italian painting section (150,000 photographs), the archive contains sizable core collections covering Italian sculpture, Still life painting, Archaeology, Architecture, Drawings, the Applied arts, and Miniatures. The uniqueness of this collection lies in the rarity of the materials and in the original arrangement that reflects Zeri’s concept of art history and transmits his attributions. Approximately 40% of the records date from before the end of the 1930s and often document artworks in different states of preservation or before destruction or disappearance. A complex cross-reference system, in the form of annotations on the back of the photos, provides information about provenance, attributions, restoration and bibliography of the artworks and connects the photographic library to the art library and the auction catalogs collection. The photographs come from national photo archives, Italian and foreign museums, private collections, auction houses, restorers. For the most part they are black and white prints on paper. Since its constitution, Federico Zeri Foundation’s first task was to ensure that the photographic Library was made accessible to users by cataloging and digitizing the photographs and setting up a freely available online database. Over the years, the Federico Zeri Foundation has attracted many donations of art history photo collections from scholars (Everett Fahy, Anna Ottani Cavina, Robert Gibbs, Alberto Protopapa, Stefano Tumidei, Luisa Vertova, Julian Kliemann), photographers (Mario Berardi, Arrigo Coppitz), antiquarians (Chaucer Fine Arts, Luigi Albrighi, Sestieri, Adriano Cera), collectors (Ferruccio Malandrini, Ruth Jones). Such materials extend and integrate the documentation from Federico Zeri’s personal photo archive. The collection, continually and strategically expanded, now holds more than 450,000 photos. More than 200,000 images, mostly referring to paintings and sculptures, are currently available in the online database, accompanied by a rich set of metadata.",
